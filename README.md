# The Following are topics covered in this Repository

# Introduction to Jenkins
- Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables the automation of software development processes. It provides a platform for building, testing,
and deploying applications in an efficient and automated manner. Jenkins is widely used in the industry due to its flexibility, extensibility, and large
community support. It supports various programming languages and integrates with popular tools and frameworks.

## Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD): 
- CI/CD is a software development practice that involves automating the process of integrating code changes,
building applications, running tests, and deploying them to production. The primary goals of CI/CD are to increase productivity, improve software quality,
and enable rapid and frequent releases. Continuous Integration (CI) focuses on integrating code changes frequently, while Continuous Delivery (CD) ensures
that applications can be released at any time.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview: 
- A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that code goes through from version control to production deployment. It consists
of multiple stages, each representing a specific task or set of tasks. Common stages include code compilation, unit testing, code analysis, artifact creation,
and deployment. Jenkins allows you to define and manage these stages, ensuring that the entire process is automated, consistent, and reproducible.

# Jenkins Setup on VM

### Install Java
  
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install
    openjdk-17-jre
    java -version

# Monitoring and Logging in Docker
- We can monitor the docker continer with the following command, the output will redirect to a nohup file

### Commands use to create nohup file
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
